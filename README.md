# revitalized-professional-portfolio

## Description

This new, revitalized professional portfolio shows the progress that I've made as a coder. Rather than using standard HTML and CSS, this project uses React to build an interactive site. All styling is done using flexbox and CSS (rather than a framework). The contact form uses Form Spree for its functionality. Icons are from Font Awesome and fonts are from Google Fonts.
