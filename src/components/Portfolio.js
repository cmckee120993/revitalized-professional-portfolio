                Users can create an account, login, search products, fill a cart, and send an order in for delivery. The cart uses global state, and the user information and the orders use MongoDB. 
                An API from mPower (a beverage business company) supplies access to the store database. In addition to the coding skills, I designed all logos on the site!</p>

                    Users within a group may then comment on the writing in the app. Groups are made private and available by invite only. Users must create a log in, create a group, and then add other users into the group. 
                    This moderator can then also remove people from the group if desired; users can make and belong to as many groups as they'd like.

                            The project uses local storage to allow users to add gear that they want to a wishlist for later. Rather than having to scroll through the entire archive, users can search for desired items, even if they aren't in the Fortnite Store for that day.
